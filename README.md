Hello to anyone reading this! My name is Brianna and I'm hoping to one day look back on this 
and all of the work I am putting in and be proud of myself. 

I am currently learning Javascript, but I would also like to learn HTML and Python later on. I want to one day build my 
very own PC and start my own Twitch channel, but until that time comes, I am preparing. <3
